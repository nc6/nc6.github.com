Hi, I'm Nick. By training I'm a mathematician, particularly interested in geometry and algebra. These days, accordingly, I mostly do probability and statistics. The rest of the time, I prod computers to show patterns of lights. I particularly like to prod computers using languages such as [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org) and [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org), though when pressed I've been known to code in other languages.

At the moment, I'm living and working in Cambridge (aka 'The other place') at the [Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk), where I work writing tools and pipelines for Human Genetics. I try not to let my complete lack of knowledge concerning genetics stop me.
